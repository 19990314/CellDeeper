This study introduces an image-based model meticulously designed for the precise identification of lipid droplet 
accumulation within the microglia (MG) and astrocyte cells (AC), subsequently enabling an in-depth study of 
the differential affinities of lipid droplets towards MG versus AC. The discernment of these cellular 
interactions is facilitated by fluorescence markers, with lipid droplets highlighted in white, MG in green, 
and AC in red. Employing cutting-edge Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) techniques, this model will automatically 
identify and quantify the target cells within digital images, offering a robust quantitative assessment of the 
lipid-accumulated areas encompassed by MG and AC cells. This methodology is expected to catalyze advanced 
image-processing models for biological applications, paving the way for a profound understanding of the intricate 
cellular implications underpinning these observations.
